AUDIT YOUR WORK:

Review the code you just wrote against these 4 criteria. If any fail, fix them immediately.

Complexity: Is there any logic that can be simplified or removed? (Simplify or delete it).

MVP Alignment: Did you accidentally leak Model logic into the View or Presenter? (Encapsulate it).

Dead Weight: Are there unused imports, variables, redundant comments, or redundant code? (Clean it).

Naming: Do variable names explain themselves without comments? (Rename them).

If you do not know the answer, or if something is unclear, say so, instead of guessing!
Output strictly the changes made and why.
